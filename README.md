Create a CollegeCourse class. The class contains fields for the course ID (for example, “CS 210”), credit hours (for example, 3), 
and a letter grade (for example, ‘A’). Include get and set methods for each field. Save the file as CollegeCourse.java.

Create a Student class containing an ID number and an array of five CollegeCourse objects. Create a get and set method for the Student ID number
. Also, create a get method that returns one of the Student’s CollegeCourses; the method takes an integer argument and returns the CollegeCourse 
in that position (0 through 4). Next, create a set method that sets the value of one of the Student’s CollegeCourses; the method takes two arguments—a 
CollegeCourse and an integer representing the CollegeCourse’s position (0 through 4). Save the file as Student.java.

Write an application that prompts a professor to enter grades for five different courses each for 10 students. Prompt the professor to enter data for 
one student at a time, including student ID and course data for five courses. Use prompts containing the number of the student whose data is being entered, 
and the course number—for example, “Enter an ID for student #s”, where s is an integer from 1 through 10, indicating the student, and “Enter course ID #n”, 
where n is an integer from 1 through 5, indicating the course number. Verify that the professor enters only A, B, C, D, or F for the grade value for each course. 
Save the file as InputGrades.java.
